# Types and Programming Languages

I am reading the book [tapl][Types and Programming Languages] and all of the implementations
in the book are given in OCaml. While this is a fine language for such things, I wanted to
do this from scratch and my functional languages of choice are Erlang and Haskell. Haskell
seemed better suited to the task so I put together this repo to track my work through
the book.
